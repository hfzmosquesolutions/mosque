## Onboarding Process

### Step 1: Personal Information

- Phone number (required)
- Address (optional)

### Step 2: Account Type Selection
Users choose between:

### Step 4: Review and Confirmation

## Security Features

### Admin Verification
- Admin accounts require a verification code
- Current code: `MOSQUE_ADMIN_2024` (should be changed in production)
- Only authorized personnel should have access to this code

### Role-Based Access Control
- Features are dynamically shown/hidden based on user role
- Admin-only sections are clearly marked
- Automatic redirection to onboarding for incomplete profiles

## Technical Implementation

### Data Storage
Currently using localStorage for demonstration:
- `onboarding_completed_{user_id}`: Boolean flag
- `user_profile_{user_id}`: Complete user profile data

### Production Considerations
1. **Database Integration**: Replace localStorage with proper database storage
2. **Security**: Implement secure admin verification system
3. **Validation**: Add server-side validation for all user inputs
4. **Audit Trail**: Log all role assignments and changes

## User Flow

1. **New User Registration**:
   - User signs up with email/password
   - Redirected to onboarding process
   - Cannot access dashboard until onboarding is complete

2. **Existing Users**:
   - Automatic check for onboarding completion
   - Redirect to onboarding if incomplete
   - Full access to role-appropriate features once complete

3. **Dashboard Experience**:
